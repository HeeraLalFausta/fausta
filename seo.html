        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p class="seo-pera4">Before moving towards the concept of SEO marketing, we must understand the concept and basic definition of the search engine optimization process. Search Engine Optimization is abbreviated as SEO. And in general, the abbreviated form SEO is the most commonly used by others. Search Engine Optimization is the organic method of bringing the quality and high quantity of internet users to a particular website/e-commerce store. This technique helps the website/e-commerce stores to achieve the increased quantity and quality of internet traffic and well-oriented brand exposure to the potential client in the digital market. As the name suggests, SEO is very much related to the search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc. SEO helps your website to get easily searched on these search engines. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="img/seo.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="seo-pera5">SEO is more about reading the internet usersâ€™ minds and predicting their online search habits. This technique accurately suggests the intent of people searching something online with a set of keywords or queries. They query or keyword what users are searching for, like the question they have asked and the search results they are getting from the Search engines are the answers from the various websites. In simple words, SEO makes your websites stand in the questionnaire on the search engines.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <h1 class="seo-heading1">What is SEO Marketing?</h1>
                <p class="">We often have heard about the concept of search engine optimization (SEO) but most of us never tried to understand the whole concept of the idea behind this process. SEO marketing is one that increases the traffic on the website. This also helps in increasing the potential customers, ultimately boosting the sales and revenue up to many folds. Search Engine Optimization marketing helps the website to have more traffic and increased sales. SEO is the gift that is enhancing their sales by increasing more website visitors for online businesses like E-commerce websites or online stores. SEO focuses on the quality of traffic as it attracts all visitors who are genuine buyers of products that you are offering. SEO not only brings traffic to your website but it brings relevant traffic who is genuinely interested in your products/services. </p>
                <p class="">SEO marketing is the strongest and most organic method of marketing and advertisement in the world of digital marketing. This actually produces outstanding results when compared to another form of digital marketing. The organic method of marketing means that the process is purely unpaid and one only needs to invest their technical skills in this process rather than any form of money. This is what makes, SEO marketing more reliable and demanding. However, when SEO is no piece of cake for everyone, so it is always recommended to get your SEO with a professional expert rather trying itself and wasting both time & money.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p class="">We have already mentioned that SEO is the organic method of Digital marketing able to boost the website/e-commerce store traffic. SEO doesnâ€™t require any monetary investment and is a much more budget-friendly method to get the same results as any paid digital marketing campaign. SEO focuses on the quality of traffic as it attracts all visitors who are genuine buyers of products that you are offering. SEO not only brings traffic to your website but it brings relevant traffic who is genuinely interested in your products/services. Always remember that paid campaigns can only boost the traffic on your website for a shorter period of time but SEO (the organic method) can boost and enhance the traffic for a longer period of time.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="seo-pera6">SEO is something that gives you a return on investment over the years if you have been able to invest the skills in a proper manner and time. The important and basic unit of best SEO is the content available on your website. Remember, keywords are the questions that are being asked by  internet users and search engines provide the best websites that can answer those questions. So this is important to insert the important keywords in your content to get listed in that list of websites answered by the search engines. </p>

        <h1 class="seo-heading3">Types of Search Engine Optimization Service</h1>
        <p class="seo-pera7">SEO can be divided on the basis of the method followed and the area targeted. On the basis of the method implemented for the process of SEO, it is of two types; White Hat and Black Hat. Black Hat SEO is mostly considered invalid by Google and almost banned due to malicious activities. However, all Black Hat SEO was not involved in malicious activities but due to some fraudulent activities, search engines have demotivated this mode of SEO. White Hat SEO is the most accepted process of SEO. We only follow the white hat technique for doing the SEO. On the basis of the targeted area, SEO can also be divided into two categories; Local SEO services and National SEO services. There are two types of SEO practices that are followed by Fausta technologies. Those two types of SEO services are:</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <img src="img/seo3.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="">
                <p class="seo-pera8">Local SEO Services: In this practice of SEO, we aim to boost the sale of a local service provider like local restaurants, juice corners, laundry service, health service, etc. This practice helps the local service providers to get more locally based customers by improving the local search results. </p>
            </div>

                <p class="seo-pera8">National SEO Services: This practice is similar to Local SEO services in terms of the ranking of broad keywords. But it may differ in the range of geographical areas, and it is a long-term investment that helps businesses to compete with each other.</p>
